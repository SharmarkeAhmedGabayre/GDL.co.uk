                    Hello World, my name is Sharmarke (Sharm #shorthand游때). I am an aspiring machine learning software engineer with
                    fullstack development skills in cybersecurity. I am currently on course to finish a MSc in Cyber
                    Security and Data Analytics with Loughborough University with a predicted distinction. I am also a
                    proud holder of a BSc in Information Systems and Management with First Class Honours (a degree that
                    blends computer science and information systems with management studies and finance).      

                    I absolutely enjoy all things tech and love the complexity and feeling of learning new things.
